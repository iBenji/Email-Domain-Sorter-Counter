# Email Counter / Database Cleaner

# Instructions
mails.txt and words_to_check.txt should should be written in column each in one line. (I left an example of both files on git)

To start working with it, just open sorter.exe and do your work there.
If you'll get there some notify messages while working with it then follow along.
