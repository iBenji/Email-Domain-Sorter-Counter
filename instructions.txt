Tips:
Your mail database file should be named as mails.txt
mails.txt should be in the same folder as sorter.py
You should have installed Python 3
Your DB should look like this on current .py script version:

example@gmail.com
example@yahoo.com
example@outlook.com
example@mail.com

Instuctions:
Install Python 3
Start CMD: write next:
1. pip install termcolor -> press enter
2. pip install collections -> press enter
3. cd PUT FULL PATH TO sorter.py (eg. cd C:\Users\Username\Documents\EmailDomainSorter) -> press Enter
4. python sorter.py -> press Enter

You need to do 1-2 steps only once, later use only 3-4 steps.
